My name is Mahlatse Makalancheche.
I am a Software Developer with a passion for continual learning, problem solving and entrepreneurship.
I'm based in South Africa, Johannesburg, and I'm working on becoming a more global citizen.

I enjoy working on the buzzword of the year technology as much as the next curious developer, but my main interests lie in Non Functional Requirements, using principles and patterns that lead to high code quality and maintainability.
I will be writing a lot about working with painful legacy systems and developing new software with maintainability in mind.

My main programming language is Java, I cleared the Oracle Certified Master, Java EE Enterprise Architect certification with
a score of 92% for part 2 & 3.
After context switching from java, I am fairly comfortable in javascript (Nodejs, AngularJs, etc), php (my first love) and I can find my way around python and a couple of other languages I have not touched in a while.

I am that developer that is not a gamer (I don't know many that are, sorry hollywood), and I am not into competetive programming but I love the skills it teaches about Algorithms & Datastructures.

I created this blog for my continual learning purposes and for sharing the lessons learnt with others, with that in mind, don't be too mad when my opionion changes.
